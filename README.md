*Profile Application using Python Flask and MySQL*
This project implements a web application for managing user profiles using Python Flask as the web framework and MySQL as the database backend. It allows users to register, log in, update their profile information, and view their profile details.

*Features*:
User Authentication: Users can register with a username, password, and email. Passwords are securely stored in the MySQL database using hashing techniques.

Session Management: Flask manages user sessions securely to keep users logged in across different pages of the application.

Profile Management: Users can update their profile information such as email, organization, address, city, state, country, and postal code.

Database Integration: Flask integrates with MySQL database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user profiles.

Template Rendering: HTML templates are rendered dynamically using Flask's Jinja2 templating engine to provide a responsive and user-friendly interface.

*Technologies Used*:
Python: Programming language used for backend logic and web server implementation.

Flask: Micro web framework for Python used to develop the web application.

MySQL: Relational database management system used for storing user profile data.

HTML/CSS: Frontend interface designed using HTML for structure and CSS for styling.
